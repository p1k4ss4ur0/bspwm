# Download

```sh
git clone https://github.com/p1k4ss4ur0/bspwm.git
```

# Installation

Run [install.sh](https://github.com/p1k4ss4ur0/bspwm/install.sh) and it **might** check and install all needed dependencies as well as move or **overwrite** all convenient files and folders.

It's wise to make a backup of your previous configuration files if you have one.


# Note

Many of those configurations are hardware specific and may not work on every system, see [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm/wiki) for more information.
